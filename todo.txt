Make .sh script that runs everything required for the nodeapp to function.
	- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19103735/run-shell-script-with-node-js-childprocess
	- sudo apt-get update 
	- sudo apt-get upgrade
	- Install NodeJS (make sure to install via github, with apt-get there is a conflict with another package)
		- Install dependencies, run npm install(make sure package.json of the nodeapp is complete)
	- Install MongoDB
		- Create MongoDB databases dir (defaults to (/data/db)
		- Create smartmeter db 
	
If everything is installed successfully, setup the smartmeter app.
	- List ports with serialport.list(); https://github.com/voodootikigod/node-serialport#list-ports
	- Get the ones that have USB0, USB1 etc in it. (mostly 1, raspberry pi has 4 USB ports and only 1 is required for the smartmeter)
	- Listen on those ports for 20 / 30 seconds to check if measurements could be obtained
		- Listen with different baud rates. The documented baud rates are (DSMR3.0) 9600 and (DSMR4.0) 115200
		- But RS-232 supports: 300, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 14400, 19200, 28800, 38400, 57600,	115200,	230400

Make readme for installing smartmeter nodejs app
	- Get Raspberry Pi (newest model always better)
	- Get cable
	- Get SD card (recommend something;)
	- If older model (32 bit) MongoDB only supports up to 2GB storage
