Technical
- endpoint /measurements that gives all days (might remove this one, not needed, was used for testing)
- endpoint /measurements:date gives data based on paramater
- endpoint /measurementsdates gives all dates that have measurements

- endpoint /priceperperiod gives prices per period (i.e. in 2014 your supplier was X)

*Following endpoints are based on 
- endpoint /calculatedmeasurement:date gives pre calculated data based on parameter (year)
- endpoint /calculatedmeasurement:date gives pre calculated data based on parameter (month)
- endpoint /calculatedmeasurement:date gives pre calculated data based on parameter (week)
- endpoint /calculatedmeasurement:date gives pre calculated data based on parameter (day)

- the data returned by the calculated endpoints needs to be fed every hour to the database

Period -> Year Month Week Day
