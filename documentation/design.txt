Left side, datepicker.

daypicker

all 

for the most recent day, ‘today’, 4 charts on main screen
- Cost related Pie chart, gas cost, electric cost until 'now'
- Cost related graph, in currency, gas & electricity (to show cost over time)

- Chart that shows usage of electricity (kW / kWh?)
- Chart that shows usage of gas m3

below the 4 charts
- selection of days with the above totals in a list
Tabbed menu (year, month, week, day) if selected the row below will change and aggegrate on that
row heading: total cost, total consumption kwh (per meter), total consumption gas (m3) 

Technical
- endpoint /measurements that gives all days (might remove this one, not needed, was used for testing)
- endpoint /measurements:date gives data based on paramater
- endpoint /measurementsdates gives all dates that have measurements

- endpoint /priceperperiod gives prices per period (i.e. in 2014 your supplier was X)

*Following endpoints are based on 
- endpoint /calculatedmeasurement:date gives pre calculated data based on parameter (year)
- endpoint /calculatedmeasurement:date gives pre calculated data based on parameter (month)
- endpoint /calculatedmeasurement:date gives pre calculated data based on parameter (week)
- endpoint /calculatedmeasurement:date gives pre calculated data based on parameter (day)

- the data returned by the calculated endpoints needs to be fed every hour to the database

Period -> Year Month Week Day

/calculatedmeasurement:date
options:
- year 				obtain lowest value and highest value i.e. (4) 2016 		looks for 2016-01-01 and (insert)
- year-month 		obtain lowest value and highest value i.e. (7) 2016-01 		looks for 2016-01 and 2016-01
- year-month-day	obtain lowest value and highest value i.e. (10)2016-01-01 	looks for and 2016-01-01
